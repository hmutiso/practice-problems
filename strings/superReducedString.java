/*
 * Solution to the HackerRank problem: Super Reduced String
 * https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/reduced-string/problem
 *
 * Problem:
 * 
 * Steve has a string 's', consisting of n lowercase English alphabetic letters.
 * In one operation, he can delete any pair of adjacent letters with the same 
 * value. For example, string "aabcc" would become either "aab" or "bcc" after
 * 1 operation.
 *
 * Steve wants to reduce 's' as much as possible. To do this, he will repeat
 * the above operation as many times as it can be performed. Help Steve out
 * by finding and printing 's' in its non-reducible form!
 * 
 * Note: If the final string is empty, print "Empty String".
 *
 * Sample Input: aaabccddd
 * Sample Output: abd
 *
 * Explanation:
 *
 * Steve can perform the following sequence of operations to get the final
 * string:
 *
 * aaabccddd → abccddd
 * abccddd → abddd
 * abddd → abd
 *
 * Thus, we print abd.
